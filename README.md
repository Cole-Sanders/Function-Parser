# Function-Parser
Correctly parses and solves mathematical functions in base 10 and base 12

How it works:
Enter a valid function with exponentials, multiplication, division, addition and subtraction and the program will solve for the correct answer respecting
the correct order of operations in either base 10 or base 12 or terminate if overflow occurs at any point in the execution. 

How to run it:
It can be run from the command line by entering the "make" command to build the project and then either ./infix_10 for base 10 expressions or ./infix_12 for
base 12 expressions. For base 12 note that 'X' represents the number 10 and 'E' represents 11 when writing expressions. After entering the expressions simply hit the 
enter key and the program will execute.
